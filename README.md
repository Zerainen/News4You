## What is it for?
- The purpose of this project is to get familiar with Android Development & Kotlin
- Covering a broad amount of concepts

## How to use it
- The API-Key is removed, since it is a private one
- To make the app work on your end you must insert you own [NewsAPI](https://newsapi.org/) API-Key into [NewsViewModel.kt](https://github.com/Zerainen/News4You/blob/master/app/src/main/java/com/example/news4you/overview/NewsViewModel.kt)

## Future To-Dos
- Make it possible to change the country the news are coming from with a RadioDialog
